Food Delivery Data Analysis - Complete TutorialOverviewThis project demonstrates a complete data pipeline for analyzing food delivery data from three different sources:orders.csv - Transaction data (CSV format)users.json - User master data (JSON format)restaurants.sql - Restaurant master data (SQL format)The notebook combines these datasets and performs comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA).---Learning ObjectivesStudents will learn:Data Loading: How to load data from multiple formats (CSV, JSON, SQL)Data Merging: Performing relational joins using pandasData Cleaning: Handling date formats, missing values, and data typesData Analysis: Aggregations, grouping, and statistical analysisData Visualization: Creating insightful charts and graphsBusiness Insights: Deriving actionable insights from data---Dataset Informationorders.csvContains: 10,000 ordersColumns:order_id: Unique order identifieruser_id: Foreign key to usersrestaurant_id: Foreign key to restaurantsorder_date: Date of order (DD-MM-YYYY format)total_amount: Order value in ₹restaurant_name: Name of the restaurant (from orders table)users.jsonContains: 3,000+ usersFields:user_id: Unique user identifiername: User namecity: User's city (Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Pune)membership: Membership type (Gold or Regular)restaurants.sqlContains: 500 restaurantsFields (from SQL INSERT statements):restaurant_id: Unique restaurant identifierrestaurant_name: Restaurant namecuisine: Type of cuisine (Chinese, Indian, Italian, Mexican)rating: Restaurant rating (1.0 - 5.0)---How to Use This NotebookOption 1: Upload Files to GitHub (Recommended)Create a GitHub RepositoryGo to GitHub and create a new repositoryName it something like `food-delivery-analysis`Upload the Data FilesUpload `orders.csv`, `users.json`, and `restaurants.sql` to your repositoryGet Raw URLsClick on each file in GitHubClick the "Raw" buttonCopy the URL from your browser's address barExample: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repo/main/orders.csv`Update the NotebookOpen the notebook in Google ColabFind the cell with URL configurations (Step 2)Replace the placeholder URLs with your actual GitHub raw URLs:```python   ORDERS_CSV_URL = "your_github_raw_url_for_orders.csv"   USERS_JSON_URL = "your_github_raw_url_for_users.json"   RESTAURANTS_SQL_URL = "your_github_raw_url_for_restaurants.sql"   ```Run the NotebookExecute all cells sequentially (Runtime → Run all)Or run cells one by one to understand each stepOption 2: Upload Files Directly to ColabUpload Files```python   from google.colab import files   uploaded = files.upload()   ```Modify Loading CodeInstead of using URLs, load files directly:```python   orders_df = pd.read_csv('orders.csv')   users_df = pd.read_json('users.json')   ```---What the Notebook DoesPart 1: Data Loading & MergingLoads CSV data (orders)Loads JSON data (users)Parses SQL INSERT statements (restaurants)Merges all datasets using LEFT JOINCleans and transforms dataSaves final merged datasetPart 2: Exploratory Data AnalysisTime Series Analysis: Order trends over timeUser Behavior: Customer ordering patternsMembership Impact: Gold vs Regular comparisonGeographic Analysis: City-wise performanceCuisine Analysis: Popular cuisines and ratingsRestaurant Performance: Top-performing restaurantsDay of Week Trends: Busiest daysDistribution Analysis: Statistical distributionsPart 3: VisualizationsLine charts for trendsBar charts for comparisonsPie charts for distributionsHeatmaps for cross-analysisBox plots for statistical analysis---Key Insights You'll DiscoverRevenue Trends: Monthly and seasonal patternsCustomer Segments: Gold vs Regular member behaviorCity Performance: Which cities generate most revenuePopular Cuisines: Most ordered food typesTop Restaurants: Best performers by orders and revenuePeak Times: Busiest days and monthsOrder Patterns: Distribution of order valuesRating Impact: Correlation between ratings and orders---Technical RequirementsRequired Libraries```pythonpandasnumpymatplotlibseabornrequests```All libraries are pre-installed in Google Colab!Python VersionPython 3.7 or higher---Assignment Questions for StudentsAfter completing the notebook, try to answer these questions:Basic LevelWhat is the total revenue generated across all orders?Which city has the highest number of orders?What is the most popular cuisine type?Which day of the week sees the most orders?What percentage of users are Gold members?Intermediate LevelCalculate the average order value for each membership typeFind the top 5 restaurants by revenueWhich city-cuisine combination is most popular?What is the month-over-month growth rate?Calculate the average rating for each cuisine typeAdvanced LevelIdentify seasonal patterns in ordering behaviorCalculate customer lifetime value (CLV) by membership typeFind which restaurants are underperforming (high rating but low orders)Analyze the correlation between restaurant rating and order volumePredict which city will have the highest growth potential---🔧 TroubleshootingCommon IssuesProblem: "File not found" errorSolution: Make sure you're using the correct raw GitHub URLsCheck that files are public in your repositoryProblem: Date parsing errorsSolution: The notebook handles date format conversion automaticallyFormat should be DD-MM-YYYYProblem: SQL parsing failsSolution: Ensure SQL file contains standard INSERT statementsFormat: `INSERT INTO restaurants VALUES (id, 'name', 'cuisine', rating);`Problem: Plots not displayingSolution: Run `%matplotlib inline` at the beginningMake sure matplotlib and seaborn are imported---Next StepsAfter mastering this notebook, you can:Add More AnalysisCustomer churn analysisCohort analysisRFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentationBuild Predictive ModelsOrder volume forecastingCustomer lifetime value predictionRestaurant success predictionCreate Interactive DashboardsUse Plotly for interactive chartsBuild a Streamlit dashboardCreate a Power BI/Tableau dashboardExtend the DatasetAdd delivery time dataInclude customer reviewsAdd promotional campaigns data---Additional ResourcesLearning ResourcesPandas DocumentationMatplotlib TutorialsSeaborn GalleryGoogle Colab GuideData Analysis Best PracticesAlways check for missing valuesUnderstand your data typesValidate joins and mergesDocument your findingsCreate reproducible analysisContributing Contributions are welcome!contact Name : Krishna Dhananjay BirajdarEmail:
